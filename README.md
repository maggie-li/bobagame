# Boba Game (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the Boba Game repository! This is an ongoing project where we are developing a fun and interactive game where users can create their own unique bobas and sell them in their virtual boba store. The game will allow players to make changes to the storefront, experiment with various boba recipes, and serve virtual customers.

Here is the idea board and wireframing
